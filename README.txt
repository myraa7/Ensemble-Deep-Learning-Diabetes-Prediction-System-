FrontEnd
------------

34. Frontend is developed with help of Flask Framework, along with Registration and Login setup with support of Sqlite DB
35. For the frontend we have used dataset for predicting the diabetes
36. User gives input as Feature Values 
37. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
38. Trained model is used for predicting the heart disease
39. Final outcome is displayed through frontend


Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentioned to use EDL model  for analysis the data and compared with other models, 
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction. 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as CNN+LSTM, Voting Classifier
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
